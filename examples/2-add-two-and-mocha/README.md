## Your Turn

Alright, let's step it up a notch.

* Add a new file called `add-numbers.js`.
* Write a function called `add()`, that takes two arguments and returns the sum.
* Include your new script in `test.html`.
* Add a new module to your `mathematics-test.js`.
* Write a test confirming that your function returns the correct sum.
* Write a test to make sure the sum is not equal to a string with the same number (e.g. `"2"` should not be equal to the sum of `add(1, 1)`).
* See if it passes.
* Adjust the *Module:* dropdown to only run your new test.

This should take you about 8 minutes.
