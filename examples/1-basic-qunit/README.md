## Your Turn

We're learning a new testing framework, so let's keep it simple for our first go-round.

* Add a new file called `the-truth.js`.
* Write a function that always returns `true`.
* Include your new script in `test.html`.
* Add a new module to you `basic-unit-tests.js`.
* Write a test confirming that your function returns `true`.
* See if it passes.
* Adjust the *Module:* dropdown to only run your new test.

This should take you about 5 minutes.
